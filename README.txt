How do mentee relationships and participation in a mentoring relationship affect student results?

This data is an edited and deidentified version of data obtained from an education research company.

The visualization displays both on average effects associated with closeness between a mentee and mentor along the x-axis, and effects associated with basic participation along 
the y-axis (in separate and combined plots). The effect associated with closeness is encompassed in the average difference between program students who reported feeling 
close to their mentor, based on analysis of several survey questions they received, and those who reported indifference or lack of closeness. The effect associated with 
basic participation is captured in the average difference between program students who met several benchmarks of basic participation and those who did not. The differences 
were found in outcomes but it cannot be said the differences are actually do to the respective attributes. A positive effect means the student performed better on 
that indicator.

Design

The markers were originally colored bubbles but it was decided to make them easier to understand and more-so related to their respective indicator category.
The visualization is zoomed out so that it is does not portray a misleading result.
The different variations of the plot are displayed so that one can focus on a particular attribute of the mentor-mentee relationship.

Feedback

It was hard to determine which color referred to which difference type.
The visualizaiton was too zoomed in.
The titles did not appropriately describe the image.
It would be better to have the data associated with each point displayed rather than just the values.
Include the area effects so that people know that not many of the points get past the low effect category.
